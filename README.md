## Kids Online Safety Awareness Landing Page

This repository contains a simple static website that advertises online safety awareness classes for kids and allows visitors to sign up for more information.

### Hosting the landing page on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository and copy the files from this directory into it.
2. Commit the files and push them to GitHub.
3. In the repository settings, navigate to **Pages**.
4. Choose the `main` branch and root directory as the source, then save.
5. GitHub will provide a URL where the landing page will be published.

### Customizing sign-up behavior
The sign-up form uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) by default. Replace the sample Formspree URL in `index.html` with your own endpoint to start receiving form submissions in your email.
